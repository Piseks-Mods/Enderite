# Pisek's Enderite

Ever wanted more dark toolset? Well you are in luck then. This version of Enderite is as dark as End portal.

After you reach the End and defeat Ender Dragon you are free to mine the all new purple Alien Stone witch your (old) best friend Netherite Pickaxe _(other tiers wont work)_. Smelt that Stone and you'll get Enderite Shard; 5 Shards with 3 Diamonds and you'll get Enderite Crystal, then you can combine Netherite tool/armor and Crystal in Smithing table to get Enderite stuff.
