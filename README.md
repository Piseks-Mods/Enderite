# Pisek's Enderite

Ever wanted a darker toolset? Well, you are in luck then. This version of Enderite is as dark as the End portal.

After you reach the End and defeat Ender Dragon you are free to mine the all-new purple Alien Stone witch your (old) best friend Netherite Pickaxe. Smelt that Stone and you'll get Enderite Shard; 5 Shards with 3 Diamonds and you'll get Enderite Crystal, then you can combine Netherite tool/armour and Crystal in Smithing table to get Enderite stuff.

## Other information:
* The only supported version of Minecraft is `1.16.5` and `1.18.2` **Don't ask to downgrade!**
